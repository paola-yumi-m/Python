### **The projects in here were made during a mini Python course offered by Hashtag Treinamentos.**

## [E-mail Automation](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/myProjects/blob/main/Python/process_automation/email_automation.ipynb)

In this challenge, our system updates the previous day sales everyday. 
The task is to send an e-mail to the boss informing the revenue and the total sold amount of products on the previous day. 
In this case, the file is located on the Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149xknr9JvrlEnhNWO49zPcw0PW5icxga) and the e-mail will be sent through Gmail.

## [Telecom Data Analysis](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/myProjects/blob/main/Python/data_analysis/telecom_data_analysis.ipynb)

In this challenge, a dataset from a telecom company that have clients from different services, including the main, internet and phone, was analysed. The data was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/radmirzosimov/telecom-users-dataset).
After analysing the past years history, the company realized that there is a churn of more than 26% of the clients.
The task is to analyse the dataset and obtain conclusions and solutions for the problem.

## [Web Automation](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/myProjects/blob/main/Python/web_automation/price_updater.ipynb)

In this challenge, the process of getting the updated dollar, euro and gold quote from a web search in order to update the prices in a worksheet was programmed. The libraries used were Selenium and Pandas. The dataset [available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KmAdo593nD8J9QBaZxPOG1yxHZua4Rtv?usp=sharing) was the file to be updated. 

## [Sales Prediction](https://github.com/paola-yumi-m/myProjects/blob/main/Python/machine_learning/sales_prediction.ipynb)

In this challenge, we created and tested a Random Forest Model and a Linear Regression Model to forecast sales based on the investment in advertising on TV, newspaper and radio.
The dataset used was [this one](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o2lpxoi9heyQV1hIlsHXWSfDkBPtze-V?usp=sharing) and the libraries used were Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikitlearn.
